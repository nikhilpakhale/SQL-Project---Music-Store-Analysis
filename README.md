This is my 1st SQL Data Analysis Project using the various DDL and DML Commands in SQL.

Database and tools used are: **PostgreSQL** and **PgAdmin 4**

This is a Digital Music Store's Data Analysis to get an understanding of the business and answer few questions to help the store understand its business growth opportunities.

While executing this project, I got to learn and practice creating a new database and tables along with multiple SQL concepts and queries related to Data types, Primary and Foreign Keys, JOINS, Window Functions, Subquery, CTE, Aggregate Functions, etc.

Thanks to Rishabh Mishra for the invaluable guidance.
